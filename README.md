# 4_Port_2.0_USB-Hub
I made a 4 port 2.0 USB-Hub with an exar XR22404 Chip. I wanted to test the schematic for the USB-Chip to use it in a further project. Version 1 is up and running here. But the costs for one complete equipped PCB is about 60€. Now in V2.0 I decreased the costs to 28€ for the parts.

You will find the:
-  CAD-Files in the folder **KiCAD**
-  The manufacturing files in the folder **Gerber-files**
-  The PDF documents in the folder **PDF**
-  The licence files from CERN OHL v. 1.2 under **Licence**

Or you order the complete Project by my friends from Aisler B.V.. The will deliver the complete project incl. all parts (excl. the USB-Chip from Exar). You'll find the project under the following link:
https://aisler.net/DK1CMB/4-port-2-0-usb-hub/main-pcb

The USB-Chip is an Exar XR22404CG28TR-F.
