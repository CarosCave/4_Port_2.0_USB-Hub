# 4_Port_2.0_USB-Hub
I made a 4 port 2.0 USB-Hub with an exar XR22404 Chip. I wanted to test the schematic for the USB-Chip to use it in a further project. Version 1 is up and running here. But the costs for one complete equipped PCB is about 60â‚¬. Now in V2.0 I want to decrease the costs to a quarter.
